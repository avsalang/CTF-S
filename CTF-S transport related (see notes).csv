In fact, if the current informal mobility solutions is not able to develop a more structured business and more efficient and safer service model , it is very likely that they will not be able to survive in the face of more formal mobility policies supported by national projects or international funds. At the same time, the possible elimination of informal mobility would come at a high social cost for more fragile sectors of the population, or for spatially marginal areas, with high risks of additional socio-spatial marginalization. The main hypothesis of the project is that there is space for organizational innovation, able to turn informal mobility to a resource/solution, rather than a problem . This space can be found upon delivering new knowledge about both demand and offer of the informal mobility sector, making use of a new abundant and still underexploited African resource i.e. mobile phone data. In detail, the project will rely on GPS-located data automatically collected, and statistically modeled and analyzed in order to provide strategic hints for restructuring the current offer and roviding safer, reliable, economically sustainable solutions to both people demand and business models in a fully replicable and scalable perspective.

The wearing surface of a pavement is usually constructed using Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA), and represents the most cost-sensitive  layer. Pavement design is performed by consultants hired during the design phase of any project. However, HMA formulation is designed by contractors engaged during the project construction. This separation through the project life cycle may  cause a gap between the materials properties set during the design phase and those obtained during the construction phase. This gap usually results in unsatisfactory performance for HMA causing premature failures such as rutting, cracking,  and ultimately potholes and limits the lifetime of road infrastructure significantly. Performance-Related Specifications (PRS) for HMA could overcome this gap. PRS for HMA is a set of quality acceptance criteria for this material. PRS must be  achieved using available materials in the market and current construction technologies. This concept has been implemented in several developed countries such as Austria. The proposed research cooperation project is an important milestone to  promote and prepare the implementation of such a great added value concept to the road construction industry in Tunisia. This project is building new links of knowledge and science between Austria and Tunisia through the cooperation between  University of Tunis el Manar (UTM) and the Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien). The project is involving Eng. Taha Ben Dhia and Professor Amara Loulizi on the Tunisian side and Professor Bernhard Hofko, Mrs Ingrid Camarago and Dr.  Johnnas Mirwald on the Austrian side. Through mobility and knowledge exchange this project aims at preparing the ground in Tunisia for more efficient material assessment in road engineering, which will ensure that tax money is spent in an  efficient and economical way. For Austria, this new partnership increases the knowledge on PRS on local material sources that are not available in Central and Western Europe and opens possibilities for further research cooperation in the  future in this region.",Transport,,,,,Road transport,,,,

The Project will significantly influence the socio‐economic growth of the North‐Eastern region of the Country. The Eastern Section Project comprises 88.1 km of railway running across the North‐Eastern region of North Macedonia. The Project has been divided into the following 3 sections: Section 1: Kumanovo to Beljakovce (30.8 km); Section 2: Beljakovce to Kriva Palanka (33.9 km); Section 3: Kriva Palanka to Deve Bair, at the Bulgarian Border (23.4 km): no previous railway development has been undertaken within this section. Therefore, the construction of the railway line and structures is required along the entire route. In this framework, the EBRD is considering a sovereign loan of up to 94 million EUR to the Republic of North Macedonia for the benefit of the Public Enterprise for Railways Infrastructure for completion of the last section of rail infrastructure on the eastern end of rail Corridor VIII, including: the construction, signalling and telecommunication from Kriva Palanka to the Bulgarian border for a total length of 23.4 km, including a station in Kriva Palanka and a halt in the village of Zhidilovo; the electrification works for the overall eastern rail line including sections 1, 2 and 3 for a total length of 88.1 km. The technical assistance project “Economic, E&S and GET assessment”, will include the assessment of physical climate risks and recommendations for potential climate change adaptation measures, the Economic and Green Economic Transition Approach (GET) assessment of the Project, as well as additional Environmental and Social (E&S) due diligence. The Project design review assignment is currently ongoing. Decisions will then be made on the scope of this technical assistance and how to proceed.",Transport,,,,,,,,,
